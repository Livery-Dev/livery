## Features

- **Visual Editor** — Design themes with a WYSIWYG interface
- **Live Preview** — See changes in real-time on your actual app
- **Accessibility insights** — Check the accessibility score of your themes
- **Team Collaboration** — Role-based access for designers and developers
- **API Integration** — Sync themes directly to your application
- **Schema Validation** — Ensures themes match your Livery schema

## How It Works

1. Connect your app's Livery schema to the Dashboard
2. Design themes visually or import existing ones
3. Publish changes — your app updates automatically

## For Teams

Let designers update brand colors, typography, and spacing without deploying code. Developers define the schema and constraints; designers work within those guardrails.
