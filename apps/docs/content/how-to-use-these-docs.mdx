# How to Use These Docs

Livery usage falls into four patterns based on two questions:

import { UsageMatrix } from '@/components/usage-matrix'

<UsageMatrix />

## The Two Dimensions

### Do you have a server? (SSR vs CSR)

| SSR | CSR |
|-----|-----|
| Next.js, Remix, Astro | Vite, Create React App, vanilla JS |
| Server injects the correct theme | Client applies theme after load |

### Are themes known at build time? (Static vs Dynamic)

| Static | Dynamic |
|--------|---------|
| Bundled in your code | Fetched from API, database, or CMS |
| Light/dark mode, branded variants | Multi-tenant, user customization |
| `@livery/core` only | `@livery/core` + `@livery/react` |

## Finding the Right Guide

| Your situation | Pattern | Guide |
|----------------|---------|-------|
| Next.js + light/dark mode | SSR + Static | [Static Themes in Next.js](/docs/examples/nextjs-static-themes) |
| Next.js + per-customer themes | SSR + Dynamic | [Multi-Tenant](/docs/examples/multi-tenant) |
| React SPA + light/dark mode | CSR + Static | [Static Themes in React](/docs/examples/react-static-themes) |
| React SPA + API themes | CSR + Dynamic | [Dynamic Themes in React](/docs/examples/react-dynamic-themes) |

## Throughout the Docs
